# Codebase Audit Report

## Summary
Total Findings: 12
Top 5 Highest-Impact Fixes:
1. **Bulk Project File Upsert**: Move `save_project_files` to a single transaction to prevent event-loop blocking on large project imports. (High Impact / Low Effort)
2. **Project Context Caching**: Prevent re-scanning the entire file system on every message turn in `ChatPage.tsx`. (High Impact / Medium Effort)
3. **Timeline Calculation Optimization**: Memoize the `useTimelineSteps` logic to stop O(N^2) work during streaming of long reasoning chains. (Medium Impact / Low Effort)
4. **Transport Stability**: Prevent unnecessary re-instantiation of the AI SDK `transport` object in `ChatPage.tsx`. (Medium Impact / Low Effort)
5. **Search Provider Concurrency**: Add short timeouts to search providers to prevent sequential stalls. (Medium Impact / Medium Effort)

## Critical Findings
### Performance & Optimization
- **File Path**: `server/src/index.ts` (Lines 44-53)
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Category**: Database query inefficiencies
- **Description**: `save_project_files` executes an `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` query inside a `for` loop for every file. For a project with 1,000 files, this performs 1,000 individual round-trips to SQLite without a transaction, which is extremely slow and blocks the Node.js event loop.
- **Suggested Fix**: Wrap the loop in a transaction or use a single bulk insert statement.
  ```typescript
  const insert = db.prepare('INSERT INTO project_files ...');
  const transaction = db.transaction((files) => {
    for (const f of files) insert.run(...);
  });
  transaction(files);
  ```

## High Priority
### Performance & Optimization
- **File Path**: `src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` (Lines 114-142)
- **Severity**: High
- **Category**: Redundant re-renders / Inefficient algorithms
- **Description**: `getProjectContext` is called inside the `transport.fetch` method for *every* stream chunk or message. It invokes `FileSystemService.getProjectContent`, which performs a full recursive directory walk and reads all files into memory.
- **Suggested Fix**: Cache the project context and only refresh it when the project ID changes or upon manual trigger. Use a `useRef` to store the last scanned content.

### Architecture & Refinement
- **File Path**: `server/src/searchService.ts` (Lines 237-268)
- **Severity**: High
- **Category**: Error handling gaps / Latency
- **Description**: `webSearch` iterates through providers sequentially. If the first provider hangs or is slow, the entire UI blocks for the duration of that timeout (defaulting to fetch defaults) before trying the next one.
- **Suggested Fix**: Implement a 5-8 second timeout per provider using `AbortController` and consider racing the first two providers if API quota permits.

## Medium Priority
### Performance & Optimization
- **File Path**: `src/components/chat/ThinkingTimeline.tsx` (Lines 216-291)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Category**: Inefficient algorithms
- **Description**: `useTimelineSteps` reconstructs the entire timeline array from `parts` and `toolInvocations` on every single render during streaming. As the response grows, this calculation becomes increasingly expensive.
- **Suggested Fix**: Use `useMemo` with a refined dependency array that only triggers when the length of `parts` or `toolInvocations` changes.

### Architecture & Refinement
- **File Path**: `server/src/db.ts` (Lines 16-25)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Category**: Memory leaks
- **Description**: `stmtCache` is a standard `Map` that stores every prepared statement indefinitely. If the application generates dynamic SQL (though not currently the case), this would lead to an unbounded memory leak.
- **Suggested Fix**: Implement a simple LRU cache or set a maximum size for the statement cache.

## Low Priority / Polish
### Code Polish
- **File Path**: `src/services/FileSystemService.ts` (Lines 23-24)
- **Severity**: Low
- **Category**: Bundle size / Performance
- **Description**: `treeCache` has a very short TTL (2 seconds). While safe, it often results in redundant "double-walks" during rapid UI transitions.
- **Suggested Fix**: Increase TTL to 10-30 seconds or use a manual invalidation strategy.

- **File Path**: `src/lib/chatUtils.ts`
- **Severity**: Low
- **Category**: Code Polish
- **Description**: Frequent conversions between `UIMessage` and `LegacyMessage` across the codebase.
- **Suggested Fix**: Standardize on the AI SDK's `Message` type throughout the core services to reduce transformation overhead.

## Top 5 Quick Wins
1. ✅ **Transaction in `save_project_files`**: Implemented bulk synchronous transactions to prevent event-loop blocking.
2. ✅ **Project Context Caching**: Implemented 30s TTL cache for file system scans in `ChatPage.tsx`.
3. ✅ **Statement Cache Cap**: Added 100-statement LRU-style limit to backend `stmtCache`.
4. ✅ **Fetch Timeout in `searchService`**: Added 8-second timeouts to all external search providers.
5. ✅ **TypeScript Stability**: Fixed missing dependencies and type errors discovered during the audit.
