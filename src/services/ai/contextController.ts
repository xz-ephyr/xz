export const COT_INSTRUCTIONS = `### THINKING GUIDELINES
1. Be decisive: For simple requests, decide and act immediately without internal deliberation.
2. Think only when necessary: Use thinking for planning, analysis, and verification only. Skip it for straightforward tasks.
3. No verbose thinking: Keep thinking brief and to the point. One or two sentences is enough for most cases.
4. No code or content in thinking: Never put code, file content, or artifact data in thinking. Put all generated content in tool calls or response text.
5. Professional output: Always produce clean, organized, and professional markdown responses.
